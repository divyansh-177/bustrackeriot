# **Polygon Area Calculator - Bus Tracking System**

## **Introduction**

### **Motivation Behind the Project**
Public transportation, especially buses, is the lifeline of millions of Indians. Buses are the most accessible and widely used mode of transport, whether in rural or urban areas, for short or long distances. However, a major challenge faced by commuters is the unpredictability of bus arrival and departure times, as well as uncertainty regarding bus routes.

These inefficiencies lead to prolonged waiting times at bus stations and confusion about available routes, affecting commuter convenience and overall transportation efficiency. Given the dense population in India and the need for effective urban mobility, a system providing real-time bus location updates can be highly beneficial. This solution would allow passengers to receive timely updates, plan their journeys better, and reduce unnecessary waiting times.

### **Statistics Highlighting the Need for a Real-Time Bus Tracking System in India**
- **Over 70%** of the urban population in India depends on public transportation, with buses being the most common mode of commute.
- **60% of passengers** frequently experience delays, with waiting times extended by **20 to 30 minutes** due to a lack of real-time tracking systems.
- **40% of urban passengers** spend an additional **30 minutes or more** each day waiting for buses, leading to substantial productivity losses.
- **25% of buses** in metropolitan areas operate off-schedule due to inefficient routing and fleet management.
- **40% of bus commuters** express dissatisfaction with the reliability of public transportation due to unpredictable arrival times and frequent breakdowns.
- The inefficiency of bus services has led to a **shift towards private vehicles**, increasing traffic congestion and pollution.
- **India operates over 1.2 million buses**, highlighting the need for a real-time tracking system to improve efficiency.

## **Project Overview**
### **Core Technology**
The system utilizes **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** technology to track buses in real-time. Each bus is equipped with an **RFID tag**, and **RFID readers** are installed at every bus station. As a bus arrives or departs, its tag is scanned by the stationâ€™s reader, allowing precise tracking of arrival and departure times.

### **Key Features**
1. **Bus Location Detection** - RFID readers detect when a bus enters or leaves a station, ensuring real-time updates.
2. **RFID-Based Tracking** - Each bus is equipped with an RFID tag scanned upon arrival and departure, ensuring accurate tracking.
3. **Bus Scheduling & Alerts** - Provides real-time scheduling information, including arrival times, delays, and estimated departure.
4. **User-Friendly Interface** - A simple and intuitive website/mobile app that allows users to track buses, receive personalized notifications, and plan their journeys efficiently.
5. **No Dependency on GPS** - Unlike GPS-based systems, this approach does not rely on satellite connectivity, making it cost-effective and independent.

### **Unique Functionality**
- **Real-Time Bus Location Tracking** - Utilizes **RFID sensors, ESP-32 microcontrollers, and IoT technology** to provide live updates.
- **Bus Timing Detection** - Displays accurate arrival and departure times at different stations.
- **Real-Time Alerts** - Sends notifications to users via mobile apps or digital displays about bus delays, changes, and schedules.
- **Accurate Data & Cost Efficiency** - RFID technology ensures greater accuracy and lower operational costs compared to GPS-based tracking systems.

## **Technical Overview**
### **Hardware Components**
1. **ESP32 Microcontroller** - Dual-core processor with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
2. **RFID Reader (RC522 or PN532)** - Scans RFID tags on buses.
3. **RFID Tags** - Unique identification tags for each bus.
4. **Power Supply** - USB or battery-powered system.

### **Software Components**
1. **Development Environment**
2. **Backend Server** - Developed using **Node.js and Express** for efficient real-time processing.
3. **Database** - **MongoDB** stores and manages bus location data.

### **System Architecture**
#### **Data Flow**
1. The **RFID reader** detects when a bus enters or exits a station.
2. The **ESP32 microcontroller** transmits the bus ID and station details to the backend via HTTP.
3. The **backend server** updates the bus status in the **database** and sends real-time updates to users via the mobile app or website.

### **Deployment Plan**
1. **RFID Readers** - Installed at bus stations to track bus entry and exit.
2. **Mobile App & Website** - Provides users with real-time updates and alerts.
3. **Server & Database Management** - Ensures seamless data processing and storage.

## **Conclusion**
This real-time bus tracking system aims to revolutionize public transportation in India by enhancing reliability, reducing waiting times, and improving commuter convenience. By leveraging RFID and IoT technologies, the system provides an **accurate, cost-effective, and independent** solution for real-time bus tracking, ultimately making public transportation more efficient and user-friendly.
